# Mod translator: NeoForge jars to native Rust mods

Goal (owner request, 2026-11-01): drop a NeoForge mod or modpack in, get native Rust Horizon mods out.
No JVM at runtime: performance is the point of Horizon.

## Design

```
mod.jar ──► class parser ──► IR (stack → SSA-ish locals) ──► Rust codegen ──► <mod>.hnmod crate
                                                     │
                                calls to net.minecraft.* / net.neoforged.*
                                                     ▼
                               horizon-compat: Rust implementations of the
                               Java API surface mods use, mapped onto Horizon
```

1. **Content carry-over** (exists: `horizon-port-pack install`): assets, data, recipes, loot, tags, worldgen.
2. **Class parser** (`crates/horizon-mod-translator/src/class.rs`): constant pool, fields, methods, code.
3. **Registration extraction**: interpret static initialisers symbolically (`DeferredRegister`,
   `BlockBehaviour.Properties` chains, `Item.Properties`) into Horizon registry entries. Covers the code
   of most data/logic-tier mods without generating Rust at all.
4. **Bytecode → Rust codegen** for behaviour methods (use, tick, place, events), against `horizon-compat`.
5. **horizon-compat**: the Java API surface (Block, Item, Level, BlockPos, ItemStack, events) mapped onto
   Horizon's native hooks (`native-hooks.json`). Grows by coverage reports: the translator lists every
   unmapped Java method per mod, so we implement the most-called first.
6. **Create and friends** need block entities, kinetic networks, contraptions and custom renderers in
   Horizon's native mod API first; they are the last milestone.

## Progress (update after every step; commit on branch `mod-translator`)

- [x] `install` command: jar/folder/pack → `horizon-mods/` (commit f1dbd01). Tested on Macaw's Fences
      (150 blocks, 222 recipes) and Create (content refused: code). Not yet checked in game: needs
      `versions/26.3/26.3.jar` in the Minecraft folder (play 26.3 once) to run `horizon-prepare`.
- [x] Class parser + API coverage report (`cargo run -p horizon-mod-translator -- coverage <jar>`).
      Measured: Macaw's Fences 19 classes / 89 API methods; Create 2692 classes, 24833 methods,
      3579 distinct API methods. Top Create calls: BlockState.getValue/getBlock/setValue,
      Direction, Level.getBlockState/getBlockEntity, ItemStack, BlockPos, Vec3, CompoundTag.
- [x] Instruction decoder (`insn.rs`, tested) and registration extraction from code
      (DeferredRegister, Registry.register, Registrate). Macaw's Fences: 180 blocks + 180 items (matches
      carry). Create: 187 blocks, 114 block entity types, 53 items.
- [ ] Feed code registrations into the carry (blocks the data alone misses)
- [x] Codegen core + horizon-compat runtime: `codegen.rs` translates all non-exception opcodes;
      differential test (`cargo test -p horizon-mod-translator --test differential`) matches the JVM on 47
      results (loops, long/float math, switch, arrays, objects, virtual + super dispatch, statics).
      Gaps: invokedynamic (lambdas, string concat), try/catch, multianewarray, dup2_x2, instanceof over
      superclasses.
- [x] invokedynamic: lambdas (captures, method refs, ctor refs) and string concat, Java number formatting;
      differential now 54 results.
- [x] Exceptions: handler tables, propagation through calls (`rt.thrown`), hierarchy-aware catch and
      instanceof (`init(rt)` registers supers), ArithmeticException; differential 59 results.
- [x] `translate <jar> <out>` CLI: writes a crate (split into part*.rs). Macaw's Fences: 16.7k lines,
      compiles clean in 9 s. Create: 1.16M lines in 69 files; unsupported: record ObjectMethods (487),
      SwitchBootstraps.typeSwitch (1), multianewarray (2). Create's translated crate compiles with 0 errors (debug, 136 s).
- [x] Records (ObjectMethods equals/hashCode/toString) and multianewarray; differential 65 results.
- [x] Runtime ↔ game: `horizon_compat::host::Host` (MemoryHost for tests), `glue::{tick_block, random_tick,
      neighbor_changed}`, generated `init` (callbacks, `overrides` table) and `start` (runs registering
      classes' static init, resolves DeferredRegister suppliers), lazy `<clinit>`, API for DeferredRegister,
      Level get/setBlock, BlockState, Blocks.*, builder chains. Test `--test hook`: a NeoForge-style mod
      compiled against our stubs registers `testmod:grow` and its tick changes the world; 0 unmapped.
- [x] Native-mod bundle: `horizon-mod-translator bundle <jar> <out>` writes horizon-mixin.toml (HEAD
      injections on tick_block, random_tick), helpers implementing Host over GameLevel, and `engine/` (the
      translated code + horizon-compat inlined as `engine::compat`: horizon-mixins allows bundle crates
      only registry deps, no path/workspace/package). New GameLevel helpers (API 81):
      `native_state_text`, `native_set_state_text`. horizon-mixins (pinned ddd9700) applies the test
      bundle to a symlink-free copy of the tree: status ok. Modded game builds (fast profile).
- [x] IN GAME: the bundle step also writes a content mod for code-registered blocks (template
      grass_block for random ticks; this build has no `random_ticks` field). Test mod jar → bundle →
      horizon-mixins apply → modded horizon-client → launched offscreen (horizon-ctl, fresh HORIZON_HOME,
      `--dev-mod content`, resources prepared from the official 26.3 client/server jars + libraries,
      SHA-1 checked, kept in scratch): `/setblock 0 120 0 testmod:grow`, random_tick_speed 1000 → the
      translated randomTick/tick put stone above, then dirt. Repro: see "In-game test" below.
- [x] `horizon-port-pack install` translates every jar's code too (single jars, folders, packs via
      inventory jar paths) into `<game>/horizon-native-mods/<id>_translated/`, plus the content mod for
      code-registered blocks. Drop of Fences + Create: both translated; Create's only gap is one typeSwitch.
- [x] API coverage metric in `coverage` (each API method called once through the runtime). api_common:
      state properties (vanilla + mod bool/int/enum, interned identity), CompoundTag, Vec3, ItemStack/Item,
      Mth, RandomSource, Component, Enum, Optional. Create 28.1% → 46.0% of class uses mapped
      (594/3579 methods); Fences 56% → 67%. `MISSING=1 ... coverage <jar>` lists the next ones.
- [x] Block entities in the runtime: `glue::{block_entity_id, block_entity_ticks, block_entity_tick,
      block_entity_removed}`, NBT bridge (`compat::nbt::Nbt`, typed puts), BlockEntity/BlockEntityType.Builder/
      createTickerHelper/Level.getBlockEntity, inherited-member resolution up mod superclasses (javac names
      the mod class for inherited statics), API base constructors. Hook test: counter BE ticks, saves
      `count`, survives losing its live object, acts on tick 3.
- [x] Block-entity hooks in bundles (block_entity, block_entity_ticks, block_entity_tick on Game; Game helpers
      `native_state_text_at` / `native_set_state_text_at`, API 81; Compound<->Nbt keeping unmodelled tags).
      IN GAME: `testmod:counter`'s translated block entity ticks each server tick and places stone on its
      3rd tick; random ticks of mod blocks are always the mod's (template behaviour suppressed).
- [ ] Next: a `horizon-native-mods` bundle per mod whose hooks
      (tick_block, use_item_on, neighbor_changed, place_block, block_entity_tick...) call the mod's overrides
      through `vcall`; (2) grow `horizon-compat/src/api.rs` by the coverage list (Level, BlockState,
      ItemStack, CompoundTag, Vec3 first); (3) API callbacks into lambdas (DeferredRegister suppliers);
      (4) in-game test (needs versions/26.3/26.3.jar for horizon-prepare).
- [ ] Old: then a `translate` CLI that emits a
      native-mod crate wired to hooks.
- [ ] (old plan item) Plan: `crates/horizon-compat` = runtime (V enum: I/J/F/D/Ref,
      object heap, static fields) + API impls keyed by mangled `owner.name.desc`; unmapped → logging stub.
      Codegen (`horizon-mod-translator/src/codegen.rs`): one Rust fn per Java method, body = `loop { match pc }`
      state machine over decoded insns; invokes on mod classes → generated fns with a class-name vtable;
      invokes on API → `horizon_compat::api::call`. Hooks: wire overridden Block/BlockEntity methods to
      native hooks (tick_block, block_entity_tick, use_item_on, neighbor_changed, update_shape, place_block).
      Typed locals from descriptors later (perf).
- [ ] In-game verification

## Resume

`git checkout mod-translator`, read this file, take the first unchecked item.

## Fast loop: the harness (use this first)

The runtime is two crates: `horizon-compat-core` (the object model: `Rt`, values, heap, dispatch
tables) and `horizon-compat` (the API mapping). The game bundle inlines both (direct calls). For
tools, `bundle <jar> <out> --runtime <path to crates/horizon-compat-core>` makes an engine that
depends on the core crate only and reaches the mapping through `Fns` (`horizon_compat::install()`).
A harness that links that engine plus `horizon-compat` rebuilds only the mapping crate and relinks
when a mapping changes; the engine recompiles only when generated code or the core changes
(~10 min for Create at opt-level 1). The bundler rewrites only changed files, so don't delete the
bundle directory between runs.

```sh
horizon-mod-translator bundle create.jar cb-h --runtime $PWD/crates/horizon-compat-core
# harness/Cargo.toml: engine = { package = "create-translated-engine", path = "../cb-h/engine" },
#                     horizon-compat = { path = ".../crates/horizon-compat" }, [profile.release] opt-level = 1
# main: horizon_compat::install(); engine::with_runtime(|rt| ...) ; drive glue::* with host::MemoryHost
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo build --release && HORIZON_COMPAT_TRACE=1 target/release/create-harness
```

Keep changes in the mapping (`horizon-compat`) where possible: a change to `horizon-compat-core`
rebuilds every engine. Minecraft's class families for `instanceof` are the mapping's
(`api_common::api_is_a`) for that reason.

## In-game test

```sh
cargo run -p horizon-mod-translator -- bundle testmod.jar out/          # out/{horizon-mixin.toml,*.rs,engine,content}
horizon-mixins apply --workspace <symlink-free copy of this tree> --mods <dir with out/ minus content> --out stage
(cd stage && cargo build --profile fast -p horizon-client --bin horizon-client)
horizon-ctl launch --game stage/target/fast/horizon-client --world T --creative --offscreen --wait \
  --resources <prepared> --dev-mod out/content --game-dir <scratch>
```
Pass `--game-dir`: the game folder defaults to the working directory.

### 2026-11-01: Create in game
- Game built with Create's full translated engine (`--profile fast`, 13.5 min, 170 MB binary): builds and runs.
- Create's content mod loads (fix: blocks whose properties sort before `snowy` use the `minecraft:stone` template).
- `/setblock` works for shaft, cogwheel, andesite_casing, gearbox and hand_crank, and the game keeps ticking.
- [x] Create blocks render with Create's own models (shaft, cogwheel, large cogwheel, casing, gearbox, hand crank, verified
  by screenshot). The earlier "invisible" was a misread: the player had fallen below the blocks.
- [x] Every block uses template `minecraft:stone` with `properties.random_ticks = true` (grass_block made casings spread and
  turn to dirt).
- [x] Every Create blockstate loads: `props.rs` follows mod-to-mod property aliases, fields inherited from vanilla
  superclasses (PipeBlock.NORTH...), and vanilla superclass definitions (RotatedPillarBlock gives axis...). Verified in
  game: fluid pipe, radial chassis, whistle extension, girder shaft, funnel, press and basin render.
- [x] Bundles inject `right_click_block` → `glue::use_block` (main hand; a click the block takes cancels the game's own use).
  Verified in game with `horizon-ctl interact`: testmod:switch toggles powered=false→true→false and places stone above.
- [x] `HORIZON_COMPAT_TRACE=1` prints each unmapped API call once, from a real game. Create's first run showed
  Java collections, its bundled libraries (Registrate) and NeoForge loading were missing, so no Create block got a
  block entity.
- [x] `jutil.rs`: java.util collections, iterators, streams, atomics, Guava Table/Multimap, natively.
- [x] `neo.rs` + codegen: the `@Mod` class is constructed with a native mod bus and `RegisterEvent` fires per registry;
  `META-INF/jarjar` libraries translate with the mod (Create: 1.39M lines with Registrate, Flywheel, Ponder).
- [x] Method resolution follows the JVM: superclasses, then inherited interface default methods (Registrate's builders).
- [x] Enums: `array.clone()` (so `values()`), `name()`/`compareTo` read `$name`/`$ordinal`; string concat,
  `String.valueOf(Object)` and `append(Object)` call a mod object's own `toString()` (generated `java_string`).
- Memory: compiling Create's engine at opt-level 3 swapped for hours on this 24 GB Mac; the harness builds with
  `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_OPT_LEVEL=1`. Stop leftover offscreen games before a build.
- [x] 2026-11-02 harness: Create registers 515 blocks, 550 items, 114 block entities, 8 fluids, no uncaught
  exceptions; shaft/creative_motor/cogwheel resolve to Create's classes with block entities that tick. Fixes: the
  `DeferredHolder` super constructor (Registrate's `RegistryEntry`), `Lazy`, `Registry.register`, loggers, `Pair`.
- [x] Runtime split into horizon-compat-core + horizon-compat; `bundle --runtime` for the harness (see Fast loop).
- [x] `instanceof`/`isAssignableFrom` follow interfaces (generated init registers them) and Minecraft's families.
- [x] Annotations parsed; `@EventBusSubscriber` classes and `bus.register(Class|obj)` listen with `@SubscribeEvent`
  methods; every `@Mod` class is constructed (bundled mods first); `NeoForge.EVENT_BUS`; `LevelEvent.Load` fires
  when the level is first used. Hook test covers a static subscriber and a registered object.
- [x] Block entities: `BlockEntityType.create` (the factory), the Java fields (`level`, `worldPosition`,
  `blockState`), the glue puts each in the level with its current state; `ModConfigSpec` values are their defaults.
- [x] Reflection (commit f3eec22): a generated `reflect(rt, class, what, args)` table initialises classes
  (`Class.forName`), runs no-argument constructors (`newInstance`, `getConstructor().newInstance()`, Flywheel's
  `DependencyInjection`), returns enum constants (`getEnumConstants`, Create's `readEnum`) and lists
  `META-INF/services` providers of the jar and its jarjar (`ServiceLoader`, catnip's platform helpers).
  `Class.forName` of a class neither the mod's nor the platform's throws `ClassNotFoundException` (optional
  dependencies). `Object.hashCode/equals` are Object's own (identity), so `super.hashCode()` in an override no
  longer recurses; `Rt::call_functional` dispatches mod objects by `name.desc`. Differential: 78 results.
- [ ] Next: harness kinetic test (creative motor east + 3 shafts, 40 ticks): read `Speed` from saved NBT; fix
  what the trace shows; then the game.
- [ ] Next: standalone harness (`scratchpad/harness`: links only the engine) checks Create registers its blocks and
  block entities at runtime; then the kinetic test in game (creative motor + shafts, read Speed).
- Note: the horizon-ctl socket path must be short (SUN_LEN), so use `mktemp -d /tmp/hz.XXXX` for it.
- Disk: a game build with Create's engine under `--profile fast` (incremental) filled ~100 GB across a few target dirs and
  stopped the session (ENOSPC). Build it with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_PROFILE_FAST_INCREMENTAL=false
  CARGO_PROFILE_FAST_DEBUG=0`, keep one target dir for it, and delete stage/target dirs you no longer need.
