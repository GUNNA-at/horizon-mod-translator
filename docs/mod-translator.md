# Mod translator: NeoForge jars to native Rust mods

Goal (owner request, 2026-11-01): drop a NeoForge mod or modpack in, get native Rust Horizon mods out.
No JVM at runtime: performance is the point of Horizon.

## Design

```
mod.jar ──► class parser ──► IR (stack → SSA-ish locals) ──► Rust codegen ──► <mod>.hnmod crate
                                                     │
                                calls to net.minecraft.* / net.neoforged.*
                                                     ▼
                               horizon-compat: Rust implementations of the
                               Java API surface mods use, mapped onto Horizon
```

1. **Content carry-over** (exists: `horizon-port-pack install`): assets, data, recipes, loot, tags, worldgen.
2. **Class parser** (`crates/horizon-mod-translator/src/class.rs`): constant pool, fields, methods, code.
3. **Registration extraction**: interpret static initialisers symbolically (`DeferredRegister`,
   `BlockBehaviour.Properties` chains, `Item.Properties`) into Horizon registry entries. Covers the code
   of most data/logic-tier mods without generating Rust at all.
4. **Bytecode → Rust codegen** for behaviour methods (use, tick, place, events), against `horizon-compat`.
5. **horizon-compat**: the Java API surface (Block, Item, Level, BlockPos, ItemStack, events) mapped onto
   Horizon's native hooks (`native-hooks.json`). Grows by coverage reports: the translator lists every
   unmapped Java method per mod, so we implement the most-called first.
6. **Create and friends** need block entities, kinetic networks, contraptions and custom renderers in
   Horizon's native mod API first; they are the last milestone.

## Progress (update after every step; commit on branch `mod-translator`)

- [x] `install` command: jar/folder/pack → `horizon-mods/` (commit f1dbd01). Tested on Macaw's Fences
      (150 blocks, 222 recipes) and Create (content refused: code). Not yet checked in game: needs
      `versions/26.3/26.3.jar` in the Minecraft folder (play 26.3 once) to run `horizon-prepare`.
- [x] Class parser + API coverage report (`cargo run -p horizon-mod-translator -- coverage <jar>`).
      Measured: Macaw's Fences 19 classes / 89 API methods; Create 2692 classes, 24833 methods,
      3579 distinct API methods. Top Create calls: BlockState.getValue/getBlock/setValue,
      Direction, Level.getBlockState/getBlockEntity, ItemStack, BlockPos, Vec3, CompoundTag.
- [x] Instruction decoder (`insn.rs`, tested) and registration extraction from code
      (DeferredRegister, Registry.register, Registrate). Macaw's Fences: 180 blocks + 180 items (matches
      carry). Create: 187 blocks, 114 block entity types, 53 items.
- [ ] Feed code registrations into the carry (blocks the data alone misses)
- [x] Codegen core + horizon-compat runtime: `codegen.rs` translates all non-exception opcodes;
      differential test (`cargo test -p horizon-mod-translator --test differential`) matches the JVM on 47
      results (loops, long/float math, switch, arrays, objects, virtual + super dispatch, statics).
      Gaps: invokedynamic (lambdas, string concat), try/catch, multianewarray, dup2_x2, instanceof over
      superclasses.
- [x] invokedynamic: lambdas (captures, method refs, ctor refs) and string concat, Java number formatting;
      differential now 54 results.
- [x] Exceptions: handler tables, propagation through calls (`rt.thrown`), hierarchy-aware catch and
      instanceof (`init(rt)` registers supers), ArithmeticException; differential 59 results.
- [x] `translate <jar> <out>` CLI: writes a crate (split into part*.rs). Macaw's Fences: 16.7k lines,
      compiles clean in 9 s. Create: 1.16M lines in 69 files; unsupported: record ObjectMethods (487),
      SwitchBootstraps.typeSwitch (1), multianewarray (2). Create's translated crate compiles with 0 errors (debug, 136 s).
- [x] Records (ObjectMethods equals/hashCode/toString) and multianewarray; differential 65 results.
- [ ] Next: (1) wire generated code to Horizon: a `horizon-native-mods` bundle per mod whose hooks
      (tick_block, use_item_on, neighbor_changed, place_block, block_entity_tick...) call the mod's overrides
      through `vcall`; (2) grow `horizon-compat/src/api.rs` by the coverage list (Level, BlockState,
      ItemStack, CompoundTag, Vec3 first); (3) API callbacks into lambdas (DeferredRegister suppliers);
      (4) in-game test (needs versions/26.3/26.3.jar for horizon-prepare).
- [ ] Old: then a `translate` CLI that emits a
      native-mod crate wired to hooks.
- [ ] (old plan item) Plan: `crates/horizon-compat` = runtime (V enum: I/J/F/D/Ref,
      object heap, static fields) + API impls keyed by mangled `owner.name.desc`; unmapped → logging stub.
      Codegen (`horizon-mod-translator/src/codegen.rs`): one Rust fn per Java method, body = `loop { match pc }`
      state machine over decoded insns; invokes on mod classes → generated fns with a class-name vtable;
      invokes on API → `horizon_compat::api::call`. Hooks: wire overridden Block/BlockEntity methods to
      native hooks (tick_block, block_entity_tick, use_item_on, neighbor_changed, update_shape, place_block).
      Typed locals from descriptors later (perf).
- [ ] In-game verification
